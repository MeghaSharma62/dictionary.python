# Write a Python script to concatenate the following dictionaries to create a new one.

# Sample Dictionary :
# dic1={1:10, 2:20}
# dic2={3:30, 4:40}
# dic3={5:50,6:60}
# Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}


dic1={1:10, 2:20}
dic2={3:30, 4:40}
dic3={5:50,6:60}
d4={}
for i in dic1,dic2,dic3:
        d4.update(i)
print(d4)
